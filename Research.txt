DeepPoseKit
>Single pose estimation
>>Image contains single individual, may be cropped from larger multi-individual image after localization and tracking
>>simplifies pose detection, does not require computationally expensive peak detection for grouping keypoints into indivual posture graphs
>>More found **Insafutdinov et al 2016, Cao et al 2017**

>Localization and tracking of individuals increases processing time of raw data
>>Automated tracking algorithms removes the labor intensive annotating process
>>Removes the need for linking posture data across multiple frames for tracking 

>Developed two model implementations
>>New model architecture -> Stacked DenseNet
>>New method for processing confidence maps -> subpixel maxima
>>>provides fast accurate peak detection for estimating keypoints
>>>Subpixel precision even at low spatial resolutions

>Discuss modification to incorporate hierarchical posture graph for learning geometry between keypoints on animals body, increasing accuacy.
>Model uses fewer parameters than DeepLabCut and LEAP

>Models description
>>First
>>>Novel implementaiton of FC-DenseNet -> Jegou et al 2017 (encoder-decoder models)
>>>Arranged in stacked configuration -> Newell et al 2016
>>Second
>>>Modified version of stacked hourglass model from Newell et al (2016)
>>>Possess hyperparameters that allow for changing of number of filters in each covolutional block to limit no. parameters
>>>Newell et all however use 256 filters for all layers 

>subpixel maxima motivation
>>for F-CNN posture estimation model, confidence maps must be converted into coordinate values
>>>Can be done by moving confidence maps outside of GPU and then processing them on CPU
>>>>Allows for easy accurate calculation of coordinates with subpixel precision (Insafutdinov)
>>>>Is not ideal as moving large arrays from GPU to CPU is not ideal, with CPU processes being more expensive
>>>Can also be done by processing confidence maps on GPU, then move coordinates from GPU to CPU
>>>>This requires confidence maps to be predicted at full resolution of input image or larger, slowing down inference speed

>subpixel maxima explanation
>>GPU based convolutional layer
>>Uses image registration algorithm introduced by Guizar-Sicairos et al. (2008)
>>>Translationally aligns two dimensional gaussian filter to each confidence map via Fourier based convolution 
>>>Allows for accurate prediction even if confidence maps are drmaatically smaller than resolution of input image
>>Even with confidence maps 1/8th resolution of original image, error did not drastically increase.
>>>Making predictions using confidence maps at downsampled resolution allows for faster inference >1000Hz

>Stacked DenseNet with subpixel Maxima
>>Real-time inference at ~30-110hz depending on resolution of confidence map
>>Faster than DeepLabCut for offline (100 batch) and real-time
>>Faster than LEAP for offline (100 batch)
>>Significantly slower than LEAP for real-time
>>Slower than stacked hourglass for offline
>>Significantly faster than stacked hourglass for real-time

LEAP (Pereira et al 2019)
>Used active learning, for iteratively modifying training set.
>>Active learning: a trained model is uesd to initialize new training data, reducing annotation time
>Applied modified version of previous model -> SegNet (Badrinarayanan et al 2015)
>Attempts to limit model complexity, optimizing for inference speed.
>Not robust to data variance; rotations, shifts in lighting, different experimental setups
>Requires computationally expensive preprocessing **(PCA?)**
>Used for single pose estimation

DeepLapCut (Mathis et al 2018)
>Proposed techinques to refine training data and minimize error on testing
>> *Achieved through: Filtering data/selecting new training data based on **confidence scores or entropy of confidence maps** from model output.
>Applied a modified version of previous model -> DeeperCut(insafutdinov et al 2016)
>Built on ResNet Architecture(He et al 2016) (state of art used for image classif)
>>Allows for incorporating **pretrained encoder** to improve performance while reducing size of training set
>>Also known as **transfer learning** (Pratt 1992)
>>Transfer learning doesnt actually provide much improvement over random initialization
>>Pre trained architecture is overparameterized (>25mill params), allows for model to make accurate preds but results in slow inference
>>Mathis and Warren(2018) found inference speed can be improved by reducing resolution of input images, achieved at expense of accuracy
>Can do multiple pose estimation


General
>Mathis et al(2018), Pereira et al (2019) popularised use of CNN for animal pose estimation(APE)
>>Made use of F-CNN, often refferred to as encoder-decoder model. (Confidence maps)
>>Mathis and Pereira have both shown high accuracies can be achieved with small training set
>>Model generalised to large dataset by iteratively modifying training set

>Nath et al (2019) proposed temporal derivatives(speed,accleration) and autoregressive models to identify outlier frames
>>Outliers can then be labeled to refine training set or can be excluded

>Speed accuracy trade-off
>>DeepLabCut has an overparametrized model (high accuracy, slow inference)
>>LEAP uses smaller less robust model (Lower accuracy, less robust to varied data, quick inference) 

>LEAP achieves limited success in comparison to DeepLabCut

>F-CNN efficiency and robustness been improved via **multi-scale inference** (encoder-decoder models)
>>Allows model to integrate large-scale global information e.g. lighting, image background, anatomical geometry
>>Also allows for integration of local information e.g. differences in colour,texture, skin patterning etc

>Most multiple pose estimation havent solved tracking problem -> Linking individual posture data over frames in video
>>Multiple pose estimation requries annotation of multiple individuals, every individual in the image must be annotated to prevent model from learning conflicting information
>>More laborious than for single pose estimation, with labour increasing proportional to number of individuals in image

>Fast poes estimation using CNNs requires:
>>Large parallel processing on GPU with large bathces of data
>>Requires downsampling images to increase speed, which increases error (Mathias and Warren, 2018)
